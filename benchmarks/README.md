# Benchmarks

Small benchmark suite for comparing different (constrained) Delaunay triangulation implementations in rust, modified from the [spade](https://github.com/Stoeoef/spade/tree/master/delaunay_compare) crate comparison benchmark.

## Constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) measures

This benchmark bulk loads mutliple real data set (shapefiles):
- **ne_50m_coastline**: 60416 vertices, 58987 constraint edges
- **ne_10m_coastline**: 410957 vertices, 406824 constraint edges
- **Europe_coastline**: 2912812 vertices, 2837094 constraint edges

Run it with `cargo run --release --example real_data_benchmark` in the `benchmarks` directory.

### Results

The dataset is both loaded with constraint edges and without (as if it was a regular Delaunay triangulation).

*The benchmark also includes a stable bulk load variant for spade that keeps the relative vertex order consistent*

(*) It seems weird that the `cdt` crate takes **less** time with constraints than without on this specific dataset. I need to look at the implementation.



## Delaunay triangulation (DT) measures

Two point distributions are tested:
 - **uniform**: `f64` coordinates are uniformly distributed in a given interval
 - **local insertion**: consecutive input points are located close to each other. A point is generated by adding a random step (with a fixed maximum length) to the last inserted point (random walk). This creates a more skewed input set.

Run it with ```cargo bench``` in the `benchmarks` directory.

Results are stored in `<repository_root>/target/criterion`.

### Results

For better comparability, measurements are grouped in point sets with less than 14000 vertices ("small") and more than 50000 vertices ("big").
